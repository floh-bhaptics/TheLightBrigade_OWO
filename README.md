# The Light Brigade OWO skin mod
OWO mod for The Light Brigade. If you have questions or issues, ping me in the OWO Discord.

## Installation
1. Get the [MelonLoader installer](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=automated-installation) and install the latest version of MelonLoader on your game executable.
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics/TheLightBrigade_OWO/releases/latest/TheLightBrigade_OWO.zip) of the mod and unzip the contents into the root directory of your game (one DLL goes in UserLibs, one DLL and the OWO sensations go in Mods).
